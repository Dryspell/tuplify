# Tuplify

## Overview

Tuplify is a TypeScript library designed to serialize and deserialize complex JavaScript objects into a tuple-based format. This approach aims to optimize data storage and transmission by reducing the size of serialized data, while maintaining the ability to easily reconstruct the original objects.

## Features

- **Serialization to Tuples**: Convert objects into a compact tuple format, which can be more efficient for storage and transmission.
- **Deserialization with Proxies**: Reconstruct objects from tuples using JavaScript Proxies, allowing for lazy evaluation and efficient access patterns.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety during serialization and deserialization processes.
- **Benchmarking**: Includes benchmarks to compare the performance of Tuplify against native JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Usage

### Serialization

To serialize an object, use the `serializeWithType` function. This function takes an object that matches a predefined representative structure and returns a tuple representation.
